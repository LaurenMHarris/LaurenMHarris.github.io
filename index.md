Hello world, my name is Lauren Harris and Iâ€™m a dedicated information professional with experience in healthcare facilities compliance, currently expanding my expertise by pursuing a graduate degree in Library and Information Science with a specialization in Digital Curation. Through coursework on metadata, database design, digital preservation, and electronic records management, I'm gaining the technical skills needed to tackle complex information challenges. 

My practical experience is broad, having experience in healthcare, government, and higher education archives. This 
blend of professional experience and ongoing education positions me uniquely within the field. 
My particular interest lies in web archiving and ensuring the longevity of digital objects. I believe in the 
importance of capturing and preserving our online world for historical and research purposes. I am excited to make 
a lasting impact on the digital landscape.

The purpose of this website is to house and redirect my various school [projects](https://laurenmharris.github.io/projects/), [list coursework](https://laurenmharris.github.io/blog/2024/mlis-coursework/), and [resume](https://laurenmharris.github.io/resume/) in a central location as a graduation requirement.
