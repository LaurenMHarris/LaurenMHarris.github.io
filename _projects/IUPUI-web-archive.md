After being awarded the [Wilma Moore Scholarship](https://luddy.iupui.edu/news/story/2021-wilma-moore-scholars), I was allowed to work for IUPUI University Library. After meeting the dean of the library and hearing the options, I decided on working the web archive in Special Collections. I did have some experience in web archiving for a local art museum's blog. 

This project is ongoing since I only work part-time but I do plan to finish by the time I graduate.
