I was first introduced to [Omeka](https://laurenharris.omeka.net/) in Digital Collections. I used my metadata knowledge to create a small collection of objects I digitized. I chose The Way of the Househusband because I had the minimum books for the assignment.  

The second collection on my Omeka site was for Digital Services Management. There was a Digitization Project Assignment and I decided instead of creating a PDF or PowerPoint, I would use Omeka for assignment. I decided on Beyonc√© Renaissance merchandise because I had seen her over the summer and I wanted to relive that moment during the semester.
